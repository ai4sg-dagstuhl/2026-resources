## Vertical Farms
#### Context
Vertical farms can grow nutritious living greens for targeted populations that require nutritionally dense foods and for making urban centres more food secure, but they struggle under high operational costs, primarily driven by high energy prices.  Our work focussed on three goals for improving the efficiency of vertical farms:
1. Deciding on interventions for improving yield and reducing energy costs
2. Automatically annotating image data
3. Developing strategies to screen seedlings for traits that are useful in adult plants so that optimal crop varieties can be identified efficiently

#### Code, tools, and guidelines
Here is an outline of the methods that we tried for addressing these challenges:
1. Causal networks using TabPFN
2. UNets
3. A range of time series analysis methods
